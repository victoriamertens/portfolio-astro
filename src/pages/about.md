My first experience with any sort of code came in a college, when I enrolled in a class called Creative Writing for Alternative Formats. Yes, you read that right. My introduction to code was not in a computer science class or math class but instead was a part of my creative writing minor.

The goal of the class was to challenge the assumption that writing could only live on a page, and to push us to write dynamic, evolving stories. One way it did this was to introduce us to Twine, a hypertext based software tool for creating interactive fiction. We were tasked to use the tool to write and build a 'choose your own adventure' story that existed as a web page.

I don't remember much about the story itself, except that it was a murder mystery set in a haunted house, but I remember the unique challenge of the project. I tinkered with very basic concepts like declaring and reassigning variables, if/then conditionals, and a lot of CSS styling to make my vision come to life. There was something so unique about learning this new language, and new way of thinking and creating, that intrigued me. I spent more time than I needed to bringing that project to life because it ws exciting to learn this new thing, to see the story in my head and see it come to life on the computer screen.

It is a little unconventional that my first lines of 'code' were written in a writing course, but it introduced me to code in a way that has changed how I think about software development. Not only do I look at software through the lens of logic and problem solving but through creativity, planning, charting, and ultimately creating something that accomplished a goal.
