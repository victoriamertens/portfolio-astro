            I haven't always been a developer. I hit the reset button on a
            previous career, turning from healthcare to software. I thought it
            would be a hard turn, but turns out being a healthcare provider made
            me a better developer because:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              I apply user centered design principles, developing applications
              through the lens of what the user wants and needs.
            </li>
            <li>
              I value accessibility and am adamant about following the POUR
              principles (percievable, operable, understandable, and robust)
              because I have seen the direct impacts difficult applications have
              on differently abled users.
            </li>
            <li>
              I know how to 'triage' issues and tasks, organizing them into
              levels priority and working effectively 'discharge' each task.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Now, I am excited to begin my journey building web applications.
            What excites me most about working in software development is being
            able to design and create things that have purpose and solve real
            world problems. I love connecting users to data that makes their
            lives easier, whether that be in their personal or professional
            lives.
          </p>
          <p>
            When I am away from my computer, I am probably on a walking trail
            getting overly excited at passing dogs, struggling through a yoga
            session at the gym, or cooking a new recipe. If you have a favorite
            family recipe, I'd love to hear about it! I am always up for a good
            recipe for Pad-Thai, Ramen, or Hot Dish.
