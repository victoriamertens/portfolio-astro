        <h3>The Ask:</h3><p>
          The editing team at Minnesota Women's Press (MWP) came to us with the
          challenge of creating an application that simplified their publication
          process. The most important thing to them was an application that was
          sensitive to their time, meaning that it was quick and easy to find
          the information they were looking for and that entering information
          into the database could be done with small amounts of info.
        </p>
        <p>
          With their needs in mind, the team and I built the Minnesota Womenâ€™s
          Press Content Manager.
        </p>
        <h3>
          From a software perspective, the Women's Press Content Manager allows
          the editing team to do four major things:
        </h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong>Add and Track Stories.</strong> The application was designed
            to allow any member of the organization's multi-person team to easily
            find and track the status of stories in the database. That means all
            users can create a story in the database, add information like due dates
            and tasks, and track its status all the way to story completion and publication.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Save Contact Information.</strong> With the same basic user interface
            design as the Stories page, each member of the team can add important
            contacts like authors, sources, and story subjects, to the application
            and attach to the stories they are affiliated with. This is an important
            function for the MWP team because it allows them to organize contact
            information based on stories.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Assign Stories to Publication Themes.</strong> The MWP team publishes
            stories each month based on a monthly theme. A user can assign a theme
            to any month of the year, making the year's planning easier for the editing
            team, and assign stories that are in the database to that month's themes.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Consult the Story Archive.</strong> Once all tasks are completed
            for each story, and the story is passed its publication date, it is displayed
            on the archive page for the user to see. This page is easily searchable,
            so the team can consult previous stories if needed.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <h3>The Tasks:</h3>
        <p>
          For the project, my primary role was focused on the backend. This
          included building the server, creating the relational database,
          writing the application APIs, and writing the SQL queries to retrieve
          the data. When the backend was written and communicating properly with
          the frontend, my role in the team was 'bug-hunting' and
          'bug-squishing'. This required running tests to ensure that all parts
          of our application was working effectively and, in the event a bug was
          found, isolating and fixing the problem.
        </p>
        <h3>The Challenges: Complex SQL Queries</h3>
        <p>
          The database we created is highly relational. Except for the user
          table, all database tables were connected to each other through a
          chain. While the database design was not complex, the data we were
          requesting from the database was. In order for our user-interface to
          function in the way it was designed, we needed a SQL query that could
          grab every story from the story table, grab every contact, theme, and
          tag associated to each story, and every invoice data associated to
          each contact associated to the story. Jokingly, our team named these
          queries our 'Herculean SQL Queries' because of the heavy lifting they
          had to perform.
        </p>
        <p>
          I learned a great deal from the experience. I learned more about
          PostgreSQL, including json_agg, the different types of joins (and the
          pros and cons of each), and the beauty of the Promise.all method. If
          you had asked me before the project which side of the http request I
          preffered, frontend or backend, I would have said Frontend. After
          working on the backend for this project, however, I am more torn. In
          working on the backend, I learned more about relational databases and
          SQL queries than I thought I would. I enjoyed the challenge of it, the
          critical problem solving it required, and the opportunity to work with
          complex data.
        </p>
        <h3>The Growth:</h3>
        <p>
          While I gained more software skills than I knew before, the project
          was a great opportunity to practice and hone the softer skills
          necessary to work on a team and build a product for a client. <p>
            Overall, the project was an exercise in <strong
              >communication</strong
            >
            and <strong>collaboration</strong>. Practicing how to best explain
            my ideas, how to effectively listen to the ideas of others, and how
            to navigate <strong>decision making</strong> as a team, especially on
            a highly restricted deadline, were core tasks of this project.
          </p>
        </p><p>
          I have a lot of reasons to feel proud of this project, but one of my
          proudest moments came when we were discussing the design of our
          relational database. I was very excited to be working with complex
          data, so the night before our meeting I synthesized the needs of our
          client into a high level design of our database. During the meeting
          the next day, I took a <strong>leadership</strong> role, taking the initiative
          to lead the discussion. I believe that meeting was our most productive
          because of the initiative I made. By opening the meeting with a general
          discussion, and taking the time to write down the team's thoughts and ideas
          on the whiteboard, a sense of true collaboration could be felt in the room
          because we could physically see that everyone's voice was being heard.
          Then, when I pitched my idea, I was able to explain it through the concerns
          and thoughts of the team which made agreeing on the design easier.
        </p>
        <p>
          I also throughly enjoyed the opportunity to present our application. I
          enjoy the challenge of writing a presentation that explains and
          engages, that takes a complex thing like a software application and
          makes it accessible to a larger audience. If you would like to view
          our team's application presentation, you can see the video <a
